# Project3


We will create a 317x317 Maze Based Matrix which will have an entrance [row/2, 0] and an exit [317, row/2] so that they are at the middle-left and middle-right of the maze respectively. We will have a sprite which will start at the entrance, and for that specific maze based on the selected traversal method, will traverse through the maze live with a tail sprite following it. Under the maze, as you watch it traverse through, important and useful statistics will populate in a live-counter uptick style, showing the nodes visited, time taken, memory, space, and other useful things as they change throughout the program before finalizing at the end. We will also have a additional maze button, which will increase the number of mazes by 1 along with the ability to choose that mazes' algorithm by which it will be traversed, along with its important statistics and the start button which will play all sprites traversing all mazes in sync. 

For this project, we will start with BFS and A* algorithms, and hopefully expand to others such as DFS, Djikstras, and more.

The technologies used and specifics of this project will be further expanded on.
